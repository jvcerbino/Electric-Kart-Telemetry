# Electric-Kart-Telemetry
This project was developed during university vacations. It uses a rotary encoder to measure the motor RPM, an ESP32 to process the data, and a 16x2 I2C LCD display to show the velocity and motor RPM in real time. However, it was never implemented in a real kart, only tested in simulation.
